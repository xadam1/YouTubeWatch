# YouTubeWatch
_This python script is simple console application, that watches youtube videos to enhance Watch Time and Views on them._

This script uses multiple threads to be as efficient as possible. We are using ![TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) to mask IP Adresses, and "maintaining" pool of them so we don't use the same IP twice. 

##### Prerequisites
- ![Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
